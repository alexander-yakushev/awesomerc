  Notable features:

  - Unitybar: tag/task sidebar. Inspired by Unity taskbar, fully supports
    Awesome tags.
  - Interactive sidebar widgets:
    + Weather widget with tooltip
    + Network widget with ping latency tooltip
    + CPU widget with processes tooltip
    + Memory, sound and battery widgets
    + Awesompd widget for Music Player Daemon
    + Time widget with calendar tooltip
  - Select any word and =Modkey-== for dictionary lookup
  - Automatic wallpaper downloader and changer (currently disabled)
  - Quake-inspired dropdown terminal on =Modkey-Return=
  - Dynamic rules, bind programs to tags with =Modkey-Q=
  - For other useful stuff see =x220.lua= and modules it loads.

* Usage

  You can just replace your =.config/awesome= folder with this repo and hope it
  works. You should also have Awoken icon theme installed.
